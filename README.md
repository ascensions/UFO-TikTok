## Description
This project automates the process of pushing the latest UFO reports from NUFORC to TikTok and YouTube. It fetches reports, processes them, and uploads them to social platforms. This project is currently under development and is tailored to my server setup, so please use it with caution.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- Google Chrome (for Selenium WebDriver)
- FFMPEG (for video processing)
- GTTS (for text-to-speech)
- Selenium WebDriver
- Undetected ChromeDriver (optional, for enhanced scraping)
- Adblock extension (for YouTube crossposting)
- A suitable font file
- `songs.txt` for background music selection
- TikTok cookies (`cookies.json`)
- YouTube OAuth client secrets credentials

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the files from the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. **Virtual Environment**: Create and activate a Python virtual environment in the project directory.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Update `requirements.txt` as needed. Also, ensure system-level dependencies (Chrome, FFMPEG, etc.) are installed.
4. **Setup Configuration**: Place necessary files (`cookies.json`, YouTube credentials, `songs.txt`, font, ChromeDriver, adblock extension) in their respective locations. Update script references to these files as needed.

## Usage
### Running the Scripts
- **Main Script**: Run `python3 main.py` to fetch and download the latest UFO reports from [NUFORC](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=all). This script generates a `sightings` folder with downloaded content and a log file for the sighting IDs.
- **Render Script**: Execute `python3 render.py` to process the sightings using FFMPEG and GTTS, creating videos in a 9:16 format in the `renders` folder.
- **Upload Script**: Use `python3 uploadTk.py` to upload processed videos to TikTok, followed by cross-posting to YouTube using `uploadYt.py`. The script waits before uploading new content.

Alternatively, use the `run_all.sh` script, which sequentially executes the above scripts and can be set up as a cron job for automation.

### Additional Features
- **Slide Show Generation**: A script is in development to create slideshows from sighting images, similar to the `render.py` script.
